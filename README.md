Feedback appreciated! First challenge submission. Really just trying to figure out how to submit a solution, so some things might be a little all over the place.

In this particular challenge I didn't feel the need to recreate the design 1-to-1 as I felt like it was more about nailing the visual elements than centering the content on the page.
